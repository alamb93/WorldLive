###Project Description

We are a team of novice hackathoners, and we designed an Android app that allows people to post information on a map about their specific locations. Users type in a quick blurb about a situation they have witnessed/experienced that others should be aware of, such as severe weather, criminal acts, power outages, and fallen telephone poles/trees. These blurbs then appear on a graphical map in the app, where others may see them for up to 10 minutes. 

For the purposes of our demo, and due to time constraints, sample locations and blurbs have been hard-coded into the app, and the duration of each geo-blurb is only 30 seconds.
