###Project Description

We designed an Android app that allows people to post information on a map about their specific locations. Users type in a quick blurb about a situation they have witnessed/experienced that others should be aware of, such as severe weather, criminal acts, car accidents (and thus severe traffic), power outages, and fallen telephone poles/trees. These blurbs then appear on a graphical map in the app, where others may see them for up to 10 minutes. 

For the purposes of our demo, and due to time constraints, sample locations and blurbs have been hard-coded into the app, and each geo-blurb is up permanently (so that we wouldn't have to restart the emulator every few seconds).

###Additional Features Not Included

We also planned to have some sort of user-confirmation system, so that other users can "vote up"/"like"/etc. geo-blurbs that they see through the app, and thus confirm the validity of what is posted. This would have been a useful tool in helping users distinguish between valid warnings and bogus jokes. However, due to time constraints, we weren't able to implement this feature.
